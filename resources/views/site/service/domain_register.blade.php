        than any other WHOIS service. in addition to the popular 
        generic TLDs like .COM, .NET, .ORG, etc., we also support
        hundreds of country code TLDs (ccTLDs). we offer a basic
        DNS check for those registries which don't provide
        standard WHOIS access and our site is IDN friendly,
        making it easy to find available domains in other
      languages.<br></td>
      <td> there are many websites offering a basic WHOIS lookup
        service, but our site offers extensive historical information 
        including WHOIS, IP address (website hosting), name
        server, registrar and screenshot history to help provide a
        complete view of a domain name's life cycle. when buying
        a domain from someone you may not know or trust, make
        sure you protect yourself by researching the domain's 
      history.<br></td>

      <td>domaintools.com offers a very powerful tool called reverse
        WHOIS which makes it possible to discover other domains
        owned by the same organization. this premium tool can be
        used to research spammers and trademark violators or
        used for competitive analysis. you can also set alerts to
      watch for future changes using our registrant alert service.</td>
      <td>in 2006, WHOIS.SC (whois source) became domaintools to
        reflect our expanded toolset for domain research beyond
        WHOIS. in addition to a simple availability check and
        registration information, we now offer domain name
        suggestions, trademark monitoring for brand protection,
      domains for sale, DNS tools and more.</td>
